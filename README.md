Xpert learning assistwas utilized throught the assignment. One area is clean dataframe for dropping the duplicate mouse by ID.
I also had a tutoring session with Reza and he helped to clean up my mice data at the beginning and the summary statistics. The sub TA Brandon helped me correct my code for putting the treatments into a loop and Grant noticed a typo in my quartile code. Grant also helped me during office hours with the scatterpolot and boxplots near the end of the code, especially the creation of copomulin_average.
